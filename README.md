# JavaLoops Project

## Overview

The JavaLoops project consists of several Java programs that demonstrate key Java concepts such as loops, conditionals, string manipulation, random number generation, and unit testing. This project serves as a practical application of these concepts through various small programs and their associated tests.

## Project Structure

The project is divided into the following classes, each focusing on different Java topics:

### Access.java

**Java Topics Covered:**
- **Loops**: Uses a `for` loop to limit the number of attempts.
- **Conditionals**: Utilizes `if-else` statements for password and number validation.
- **Input Handling**: Reads user input using `Scanner`.

**Description:**
This class implements a password validation program. The user is prompted to enter a password and a number up to three times. If the correct password and number are entered, access is granted; otherwise, access is denied.

### Convert.java

**Java Topics Covered:**
- **Loops**: Uses a `do-while` loop for the conversion process.
- **String Manipulation**: Handles string concatenation and reversal.
- **Input Handling**: Reads user input using `Scanner`.

**Description:**
This class converts a given decimal number to its octal representation. It reads the decimal number from the user, performs the conversion, and displays the octal value.

### Support.java

**Java Topics Covered:**
- **String Manipulation**: Implements a method to reverse a string using a `for` loop.

**Description:**
This class contains a helper method used in the Convert class to reverse a string. It demonstrates string handling and loop usage for reversing the order of characters in a string.

### ThrowDie.java

**Java Topics Covered:**
- **Random Number Generation**: Uses the `Random` class to simulate dice rolls.
- **Loops**: Uses a `for` loop to iterate through the number of dice throws.
- **Conditionals**: Utilizes `if-else` statements to determine and display dice faces.
- **Input Handling**: Reads user input using `Scanner`.

**Description:**
This class simulates the throwing of a die a specified number of times and displays the result of each throw, illustrating the concept of randomness and loop control.
